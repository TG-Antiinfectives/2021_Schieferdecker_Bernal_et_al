# Code for Manuscript: Development of Predictive Classification Models for Whole Cell Antimycobacterial Activity of Benzothiazinones

&nbsp;

Repository with code for general data analysis and model building and validation described in our manuscript [Schieferdecker, Bernal et al., *J. Med. Chem.* **2022**, 65, 6748](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.2c00098).

&nbsp;

For reproducibility, the `conda` environment used can be built from the `environment.yaml` file as follows:

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
&nbsp;

The `notebooks` represent the different parts of the manuscript. Several `Python` functions created to accomplish specific tasks within each `notebook` are found in the `Scripts`folder.
